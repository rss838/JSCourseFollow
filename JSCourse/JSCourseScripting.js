/*constants that are hard coded, and pre-know
should always be capitalized. My sanity is 0, I know that it
is 0, and I also know that it will always be 0. So, Therefore,
It should be a capitalized constant.
There are also other constants as well, constants that are
unchanging, but not always known or not known until run time are
not capitalized. Example:
const pageLoadTime = 1231232131;
constants also don't necesarily need to be defined immediatly
